Two Dave Thomas-designed courses set across 300 hectares of Provençal woodland, attached to a Five-star resort with spa, Michelin-star dining, and the Albatros Golf Performance Center (one of only two European Tour Performance Institutes in Europe). Le Château is the flagship — long, strategic, immaculately maintained, with firm greens and sweeping views of medieval hilltop villages. Le Riou is members and hotel guests only.

                            <p>A Robert von Hagge design tucked into the secluded Vallon de l'Oeuf valley, just 10 minutes from Cannes. Narrow, hilly, technical — waterfalls, lakes, bunkers everywhere. Fast, undulating greens reward precision over power. This is a members' course that welcomes visitors (max handicap 28/32, advance booking essential). On-site 4-star hotel, Cinq Mondes spa, and panoramic restaurant.

                            <p>One of Europe's most spectacular golf experiences. Perched at 900 metres above sea level, overlooking Monaco, France, and Italy simultaneously. Designed by Willie Park Jr. in 1911, this is Riviera golf history. The 5th hole offers the most photographed tee box on the Côte d'Azur — a panoramic view across three countries. Comparatively short (5,700m) but the altitude, wind, and elevation changes make it play longer. The clubhouse has old-school elegance. Green fee €70-170. 30 minutes from Monaco, 40 from Nice.</p>

A traditional parkland course winding through the protected Valmasque forest, with the Bouillide river creating natural water hazards. Fast, tricky greens. Hosted the European Tour's Cannes Open 14 times — Seve Ballesteros, Greg Norman, and Ian Woosnam are all on the honours board. Beautiful stone clubhouse. Green fee €70-120.

The defining quirk: a railway line splits the course north-south (crossed by bridge) and a river splits it east-west (crossed by ferryman). Yes, a ferryman. Charming half-timbered clubhouse. Two courses: the Grand Duke (18-hole) and a 9-hole. Green fee €60-100. 5 minutes from the beach, 20 from Cannes.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is the best golf course on the French Riviera?</h3>
                        <p>Terre Blanche (Le Château course) is widely considered the best golf course on the French Riviera and regularly ranks among France's top 10. It offers the highest standard of course conditioning, facilities, and service in the region. For a more traditional experience, Cannes-Mougins has the deepest history. For the best views, Monte-Carlo Golf Club is unmatched.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How many golf courses are on the French Riviera?</h3>
                        <p>There are over 20 golf courses on the French Riviera (Côte d'Azur), concentrated between Monaco in the east and Saint-Tropez in the west. Most are located in the hills behind the coast, typically 20-45 minutes from the seafront. The majority are 18-hole courses, with a few 9-hole options for shorter rounds.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What do green fees cost on the French Riviera?</h3>
                        <p>Green fees on the French Riviera range from approximately €55 to €200+ depending on the course, season, and day of the week. Budget-friendly courses like Grande Bastide and Opio-Valbonne start around €55 in low season. Premium courses like Terre Blanche and Royal Mougins range from €95 to €200. Most courses offer reduced rates in winter (November-March) and for afternoon tee times in summer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I play golf on the French Riviera year-round?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. The French Riviera enjoys a Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of sunshine per year. Golf is playable every month, though the most comfortable playing conditions are in spring (April-June) and autumn (September-November). Summer (July-August) can be hot, with many courses offering reduced afternoon rates. Winter is mild (10-15°C) and courses are quiet — many golfers consider it the best-kept secret for off-season Riviera golf.</p>

                        <h3>Is a buggy / golf cart required on French Riviera courses?</h3>
                        <p>Policies vary by course. Terre Blanche requires a cart in summer (included in the green fee year-round). Royal Mougins includes a cart in all green fees. Most other courses offer optional cart rental (typically €30-45). Grande Bastide, Opio-Valbonne, and Saint-Donat are all walkable. The Old Course Mandelieu is completely flat — no cart needed. Monte-Carlo and Taulane are hilly enough that a cart is strongly recommended.</p>

Courses near the major yachting ports of Antibes, Cannes, and Saint-Tropez are all accessible for a half-day excursion from the boat.</p>
